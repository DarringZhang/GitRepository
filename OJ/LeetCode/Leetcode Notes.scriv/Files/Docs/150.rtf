\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs26\b0\i0 The first thing to notice in the inspector is the index card at the top. This appears in the Notes, References and Keywords panes of the inspector (but not in the Snapshots or Comments panes, which require more space). The index card is an important concept in Scrivener. You can type a synopsis of your document into the body of the index card (note the header of the index card can be used to rename the document, too). One of the core ideas behind Scrivener is that every document (or chunk of text, or image, or whatever) is associated with a synopsis, which is represented in the inspector by the index card. You can then view these synopses in different ways (which we will come to later) which will make outlining and organising your work easier. The best way to understand this is to imagine that each document in Scrivener is a sheet of paper that has an index card clipped to it containing a summary of the document\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s contents, which can then be viewed alongside other index cards to get an overview of the whole.}

To do so, just click on the icon of the index card with two arrows next to it in the header at the top of the inspector and choose the image icon.
